* podman.el
=podman.el= is a package for managing Podman pods from inside Emacs.
It is a complement to [[https://github.com/Silex/docker.el][docker.el]], which claims to already support both Docker and Podman.
=podman.el= only provides a functionality related to pods, which is a feature only supported by Podman and not by Docker.
** Installation
You have to install =podman= first.

This package is not available on MELPA yet, so you have to install it like other packages.
** Usage
=podman-pod-list= command displays a list of pods.
In the tabular interface, you can perform operations on pods.
=podman-pod-help= (=?= key) displays a list of commands, which serves as a mnemonic.
